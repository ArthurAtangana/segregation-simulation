# Slide 2 - Segregation Overview
- Segregation models where first introduced by economist Thomas Schelling.
- It studies the idea that self-segregation is a strong motivating factor when people make decisions on where to live.
- The main proposition of Schelling's model, is that a simple individual preference will lead to large scale segregation within a specific geographic location (like a city).
- Things like income, language or race, but also any group identity leads to this kind of effect.
# Slide 3 - Current Behaviours
- As this is a continuation of assignment 2, the current model simulates a basic 2 group system, with a pseudo-random, but really first come first serve assignment.
- the current rules show that when the current individual (or cell), looks at their 3 by 3 neighbourhood, if they are not in the majority, they move to the first empty location.

- This is an example of a simulated run.
- The move is not truly random, but uses first come first serve. Cadmium's run time makes this look random but it is actually not.
# Slide 5 - Future Behaviours
- While this is a simple example, there are many other things that would influence these group behaviours.
- Truly random assignment when a cell moves, would be an interesting behaviour. Although this is not super realistic as people do not choose to live in random places. In this case, we could observe very long runs where cells take a long time to be satisfied.
- Progessive assignment is another solution that propose interesting behaviours and patterns. By moving a cell based on the current state of the grid, this means that a cell will move to the most ideal location. This is probably the most realistic scenario.
# Slide 6 - Future Behaviours
- Currently, the simulation is a simple red vs grey. In real life, there are many variation of factors that makes up the group identity of a person. Complex rules based on multiple factor would lead to much more complex patterns. For example, cells could want to be next to other cells based on 2-4 factors like favorite sport and income.
- Another question from Schelling's paper that is interesting it to introduce variable thresholds for acceptability. This means that we would be able to observe the patterns that lead to segregation based on the degree of preference from cells. For example, the system is currently at a majority, but what about a scenario where you want at least 20% of similar cells in your neighorhood? The idea is to answer the question, what threshold leads to high segregation?
# Slide 7 - Future Behaviours
- Looking at assymetric models, there are a couple of interesting things that can relate to the segregation model.
- Weighted neighbors would introduce the idea that specific cells could have higher pulls compared to others. For example, a grey cell wants to be around other grey cells, but is more inclined to be in a less grey area if one of those cells is a family member.
- Partial vision would also lead to interesting segregation behavior. For example, a cell will look only at the cells on the left. This simulate the sometime strick divides between neighborhoods, or a literal divide like a wall, mountain, highway.
- Schelling's model is critisied for its lack of taking into account outside pressure, which at the time where the Jim Crow laws. Outside pressures would be something that would influence the behaviour of cells and have its place in the project. the coupled model introducing lower or higher thresholds at different times of the simulation would affect the cell's assignment greatly.
